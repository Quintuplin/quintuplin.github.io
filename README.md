created by following the guide at: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

this blog was made for CSCI 362 Software Engineering, but will include imported blog posts from CSCI 392 Seminar on Computing & Society. In future, I hope that it will also include blog posts from an illustrious career in CS - but at very least expect a resume to be added and linked shortly.
