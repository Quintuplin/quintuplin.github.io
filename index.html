	    Hello! I am Jack Fraser, with a B.S. in C.S. and experience in Full Stack Develoment and Systems Administration
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Graduated Dec 2019 from the College of Charleston, but have been living computers before and since.
	    <br>
	    <br>Feel free to browse my Github repository, which is linked at the bottom of this page.
		<br>My best work is under NDA, however, and as such is not on here! Tragic!
	    <br>
		<br>But I am more than happy to demonstrate my capabilities in other ways!
	    <br>
	    <br>Enjoy
	</p>
