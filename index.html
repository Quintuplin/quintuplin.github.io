	    Hello! I am Jack Fraser, a Computer Scientist with a Bachelors of Science!

	    You may view my Resume on the resume tab, blog posts on the blog tab, and feel free to browse my Github repository, which is linked at the bottom of this page. My best projects are not public, however, so even if you do not see what you are looking for, I may still be able to demo it in interview.
