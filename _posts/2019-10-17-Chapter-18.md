## 18.4. Define an interface specification for the Currency Converter and Check credit rating services shown in Figure 18.7

## Currency Converter:
* utility service
* task-oriented
* not independent; relies on access to current exchange rates
* state not stored

### Interface:
```
<interface name = “currency-converter” >
  <operation name = “get-conversion” pattern = “wsdlns: in-out”>
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:from-amt” />
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:from-curr” />
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:to-curr” />
    <output messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:to-amt” />
    <outfault messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:InDataFault” />
  </operation>
</interface>
```

### REST:
* no security required, ease of access primary importance
* Example url-based REST implementation:
* baseurl/ ? amount= VALUE & from= CURRENCY & to= CURRENCY  
* e.g. (www.example.com/currency-converter/?amount=123-45&from=USD&to=JPY) to convert 123.45 US Dollars to Japanese Yen

## Credit Rating:
* more secure, autentication required(?)
* business service
* task-oriented
* not independent; relies on access to credit monitoring systems
* state not stored

### Interface:
```
<interface name = “credit-retriever” >
  <operation name = “get-credit” pattern = “wsdlns: in-out”>
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:user-ID” />
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:password” />
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:target-ssn” />
    <output messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:cred-score” />
    <outfault messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:InDataFault” />
  </operation>
</interface>
```

### SOAP:
* Should require authentication & more advanced user logging  
* Shouldn't be URL-based due to the inherent security required regarding usage of SSNs
* Must track users & permissions within the system
