# 18.4. Define an interface specification for the Currency Converter and Check credit rating services shown in Figure 18.7

## Currency Converter:
* utility service
* task-oriented
* not independent; relies on access to current exchange rates
* state not stored

### Interface:
```
<interface name = “currency-converter” >
  <operation name = “get-conversion” pattern = “wsdlns: in-out”>
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:from-amt” />
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:from-curr” />
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:to-curr” />
    <output messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:to-amt” />
    <outfault messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:InDataFault” />
  </operation>
</interface>
```

### REST:

baseurl/ ? amount= VALUE & from= CURRENCY & to= CURRENCY

Example: example.com/currency-converter/?amount=123-45&from=USD&to=JPY

to convert 123.45 US Dollars to Japanese Yen

## Credit Rating:
* business service
* task-oriented
* not independent; relies on access to credit monitoring systems
* state not stored

### Interface:
```
<interface name = “credit-retriever” >
  <operation name = “get-conversion” pattern = “wsdlns: in-out”>
    <input messageLabel = “In” element = “c-conv:ssn” />
    <output messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:cred-score” />
    <outfault messageLabel = “Out” element = “c-conv:InDataFault” />
  </operation>
</interface>
```

### REST:

baseurl/ ? ssn= SSN

Example: example.com/credit-rating/?ssn=1234567890

to retrieve the credit score for SSN 1234567890
