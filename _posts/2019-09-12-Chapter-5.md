### 5.3. You have been asked to develop a system that will help with planning large-scale events and parties such as weddings, graduation celebrations, and birthday parties. Using an activity diagram, model the process context for such a system that shows the activities involved in planning a party (booking a venue, organizing invitations, etc.) and the system elements that might be used at each stage.

### 5.5. Develop a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a student registers for a course in a university. Courses may have limited enrollment, so the registration process must include checks that places are available. Assume that the student accesses an electronic course catalog to find out about available courses.

### 5.7. Based on your experience with a bank ATM, draw an activity diagram that models the data processing involved when a customer withdraws cash from the machine.

### 5.8. Draw a sequence diagram for the same system. Explain why you might want to develop both activity and sequence diagrams when modeling the behavior of a system.

I would probably want to develop both activity and sequence diagrams because the activity diagram is useful for determining what has to happen in broad strokes, while the sequence diagram keeps it very clear as to what has to interface (and interpret) from what, in a more strict and descriptive manner. However, I would even more want to simply draw these on normal paper. Diagrams are great when designing and implimenting the project in question, but there is no denying the process of making them can be painful, especially when dragging little boxes and arrows around a screen.
