I am Jack Fraser, a Senior in Computer Science at the College of Charleston. This semester (Fall 2019) will see many posts to this blog for assignments for this CSCI 362 - Software Engineering.

Blog Posts for this class will be titled with "HWX: Title", and will focus on answering and responding to questions and articles with a Software Engineering focus. The earlier of these were originally uploaded to Wordpress. The later (4+) are published exclusively to this quintuplin.github.io

This blog, however, does include posts not for this class; Some are from CSCI 392, and others (yet to be written) will hopefully punctuate an illustrious carreer within CS.

My hobbies include trying to utilize WSL for intended-for-full-linux applications, making .exes in Python, and utilizing vscode religiously. I have an irrational dislike of Java, and pretend to like C despite actually being rather scared of it. Nonetheless, my next target language to learn is c++, especially when accounting for its versatility and power when it comes to user interfaces. The Visual Studio XAML Designer is just too tempting. 

I am happily married, and spend way too much time daydreaming about video games.

Welcome.
