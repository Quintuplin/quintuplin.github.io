## 20.10. You work for a software company that has developed a system that provides information about consumers and that is used within a SoS by a number of other retail businesses. They pay you for the services used. Discuss the ethics of changing the system interfaces without notice to coerce users into paying higher charges. Consider this question from the point of view of the company’s employees, customers, and shareholders.

### This question is worded confusingly, so my translation is thus:
* Employees -> Clients (people who work in the companies which are utilizing the software)
* Customers -> Customers of the Clients (people who are being tracked by this system)
* Shareholders -> Investors (people who have financial interest in the success of the company making this decision)

### Employees:

Coersion isn't ethical. This is how you lose clients, who *might* decide that instead of paying you more and having to redo the work re-implementing your service, they'd rather not.

### Customers:

Tracking and redistributing customers' personal data isn't ethical. By being so blatant with your fleecing of this data, you are making enemies who might bring to the attention of the court system that you are profiting off data which isn't strictly speaking yours. Laws regarding the rights of an individual over their own personal data have lagged behind technology; you might make history in helping those laws catch up.

### Shareholders:

Shareholders in this business are investing in an openly unethical business. They should move their investments elsewhere, as the short term gains for the company will be outweighed by the long-term effect of bad business and acting in bad faith. Investors might not care about ethics, but they will care when bad ethics lead to loss of clients, or worse, lawsuits.

Hopefully your actions lead to you going out of business.
